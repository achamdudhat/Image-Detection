Handwritten Image Recognition Project
This project involves the development of deep learning models using TensorFlow for the recognition of handwritten images. The following tasks were undertaken:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to handle a dataset comprising more than 65,000 handwritten images. This CNN was trained to recognize patterns and features within the images, enabling accurate classification.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
In addition to CNNs, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was designed specifically for the task of image recognition.
